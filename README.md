We are students from Florida Atlantic University. We made this app for our Intro to Artificial Intellegence. It was really interesting, and we had fun along the way. 
Our code is different from our original Tic Tac Toe game that we made in python since the syntax from Streamlit is completely different. 

Keep in note that if you ever build something like this, make sure to do your research on what kind of syntax the program that you are deploying the app uses because we struggled at first. Overall, such a great experience and we got to get together and learn to work as a group.
